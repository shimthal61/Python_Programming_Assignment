To run the program, please navigate to the file titled 'Program_Script'. I've named the data file for the assignment 'data.csv', so ensure that you type that in when reading in the data file. This program should be compatible with any 2-way repeated measures ANOVA data file in long format. Future developments will involve making the code more efficient and making it compatible with 2-way independent ANOVAs.
