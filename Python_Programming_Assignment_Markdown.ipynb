The `{numpy}` package will allow us to work with arrays in our dataset and provides the means to generate specific descriptive statistics. `{pandas}` allows us to read in our csv file, whilst `{seaborn}` provides attracitive and informative data visualisations based on `{matplotlib}`, a library for creating visualisations in its own right. The `ols()` function imported from `{statsmodels.formula.api}` creates models from a formula and dataframe, while `stats()` from `{scipy}` enables us to run t-tests.

    "First of all, I introduce the program within the `print()` function. Following, I use the `def` keyword to define my first function - `load_data_function()`. Any variables created or changed within a variable will only be stored locally within that variable by default. If such a variable is called outside the function, it won't be recognised. Therefore, I use the `global` keyword to make all the variables that I want to use outside the function accessible. Once all the appropriate variables have been modified to be global, I create a new variable called `file`. By using the `input()` function, I can make the value of `file` equalivalent to whatever the user enters. The input is preceded by some information about what is required from the user. I then add my first `if` keyword, where the following indented code will only run if the statement is met. The requirements for it to run are for `file` to contain the string `.csv`. This is a basic error-handling technique which prevents the user from attempting to read in a non-csv file type. If the `if` statement is met, the following code reads in the data using the `pd.read_csv()` function and renames the first data column 'Participant'. Through the use of indexing combined with the `unique()` function, it also maps all the salient aspects of the data, including the columns and levels, on to defined variables. However, it is worth noting that, in its current state, the program will not run properly if the data columns are not in the following order - Participant, IV1, IV2, DV. If the file inputted by the user does not contain the string `.csv`, then my `else` statement will run, which tells the user to ensure the file is on csv type. Within the `else` statement, I also added my first `again` function, which I'll be using substantially throughout the code. As I subsequently define, the `load_data_function_again()` function simply repeats the `load_data_function()`. The final line of code determines where the `load_data_function()` ends. "

I first define `tidy_data_function()`, then make the variables I'll be manipulating global. Following this, the user has the option to rename the columns or the levels through the use of the `input()` variable `columns_levels`. If 1 is entered, then the variables `IV1`, `IV2`, and `DV` will be updated to match the input. This is carried out by mapping the new entered variables onto a new dataset, then passing this into `data` using the `rename()` function.

I also utilised the 'new line character' `\\n` to break up the string. The following code words similar to rename the dataframe columns, except that we use the `replace()` function instead of the `rename()` function to modify the data points in our dataset. In the event that the user decides to skip the data tidying option, we map our our new levels on to the old ones, which means that we won't have to differentiate in later functions which one to call.

The `catplot` functions is a relatively new addition to seaborn, and provides a framework for several types of plots that show the relationship between a numerical variable and one or more categorical variables. The different plots can easily be specifed within the `kind` argument. I decided to give the user access to 7 of the `catplot` graphics, as different plots can aid data interpretability.  \n",

Within the function, we add the data from `Prime` and `Reaction Time` to the x and y axes, respectively. To add in our `Target` data as a second categorical variable, we call it in the `hue` argument. We next specify the name of our source dataframe, and what type of catplot we want to create. I set the `kind` parameter to be whatever the `vis_type` variable was defined as (e.g. 'strip', or 'point'). I also set the confidence intervals to be appropriate to the visualisation by passing the `ci` variable to the `ci` parameter. Finally, I adjust the aspect ratio to 1.5x size, to promote readability.\n",

Using the variables `IV1`, `IV2`, and `DV`, the title will adjust depending on the dataset, which modifies the title to make it applicable to different datasets.

    "In our output, I generated a swarm, boxen, and point plot. Although our swarm plot doesn't tell us much about relationships in our data, our boxen plot validates what we interpreted from our summary statistics. It appears that participants were quickest at responding to a target image when the image's valence was consistent with the prime image preceding it. Our point graph plots the interaction between our two independent variables. We can see here that we have a crossover interaction as the polarity of the difference flips. The graph shows that reaction time was faster for positive target images when the preceding prime image was also positive. Likewise, reaction time was faster for negative target images when the preceding prime image was also negative. Due to our crossover interaction, it is unlikely that we'll have significant main effects of *both* `Prime` and `Target` variables, but a significant interaction effect is likely."
