# Python_Programming_Assignment

To run the program, please navigate to the notebook titled 'Python_Programming_Assignment_Script'. I've named the data file for the assignment 'data.csv', so ensure that you type that in when reading in the data file. Before reading through the markdown, I suggest first running through the program to get the full scope of what it can do. This program should be compatible with any 2-way repeated measures ANOVA data file in long format. Future developments will involve making the code more efficient and making it compatible with 2-way independent ANOVAs.
